/*
* Iroha Encryption Software by Iskra#0332. Project began in December of 2018.
*
* The main class is fairly short at the moment and the ComTree class attemps to handle
* as much of the command line work as possible before being sent to a cipher file.
*
* If you understand the Iroha and ComTree class before you jump into a cipher file, it could
* help in understanding a cipher file and why it was made the way it was.
